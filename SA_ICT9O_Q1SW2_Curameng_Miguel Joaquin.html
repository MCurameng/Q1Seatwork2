        <td>Crisostomo Ibarra</td>

       	<td>María Clara</td>
       	<td>Who is María Clara? In the novels, María Clara is described as a devout Roman Catholic who became the epitome of virtue, "demure and self-effacing,” humorless and prone to fainting. Her traits were further described by Rizal as an "Oriental decoration" with "downcast" eyes and a "pure soul".</td>

   	<td>Padre Damaso</td>
   	<td>Padre Damaso was known to be friendly with the Ibarra family, so much that Crisóstomo was surprised by what the former curate had done to Don Rafaél. Padre Dámaso is described to be a snobbish, ruthless and judgemental extrovert.</td>

   <td>Padre Salvi</td>
